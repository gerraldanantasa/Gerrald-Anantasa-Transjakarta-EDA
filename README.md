# Transjakarta EDA - Data-Driven Strategies for Enhancing TransJakartaâ€™s Service and Revenue
## Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of **TransJakarta**, the bus rapid transit (BRT) system in Jakarta, Indonesia. TransJakarta serves millions of passengers daily, and as the system grows, understanding the demographics, peak periods, and customer preferences is crucial for improving service delivery and boosting revenue. The goal of this analysis is to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions for enhancing customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and profitability.

The dashboard visualizes the key findings of the analysis, offering interactive charts and trends on commuter demographics, ridership patterns, revenue insights, and more.

## Main Findings

### 1. Demographic Profile Analysis
- **Age Group**: The majority of TransJakarta commuters (54.5%) are working professionals (25-44 years), followed by students (18-24 years) and occasional commuters (45-64 years).
- **Gender Distribution**: There is a slight majority of female commuters (53.3%), with women primarily in the 32-41 age range. This suggests a need for targeted marketing campaigns for female commuters, especially in the younger age groups.
- **Frequent Customer Segments**: Female commuters in the 25-44 age group (working professionals) and students (18-24 years) represent the largest and most frequent ridership segments.

### 2. Bank Preference Analysis
- **Dominant Bank**: Bank DKI is the most preferred payment method, making up nearly 50% of transactions, while digital wallets like e-Money and Brizzi are growing in popularity, especially among Millennials and Gen Z.
- **Generational Preferences**: Millennials and Gen Z show a strong preference for digital payment options, while Boomers and the Silent Generation prefer traditional banks.

### 3. Peak Period Identification
- **Weekday Ride Frequency**: Peak ride times occur between 6-7 AM and 5-6 PM, reflecting typical work and school commuting hours. Saturday and Sunday see a significant drop in ridership, indicating a reliance on TransJakarta during weekdays.
- **Station Demand**: Garuda Taman Mini is the busiest station during peak morning hours, surpassing the overcrowding threshold, while Pejaten and Seskoad stations dominate during evening commutes.

### 4. Revenue Trends
- **Revenue by Service**: TransJakarta contributes the largest portion of weekday revenue (~IDR 61.4M), while Royal Trans, despite a smaller customer base, generates significant revenue (~IDR 50.9M) due to its premium pricing.
- **Gender and Age Impact**: Female commuters generate higher revenue in younger age groups (12-41 years), especially in work-related ridership. Work commuters are the largest contributors to weekday revenue.
- **Weekend Revenue Decline**: Weekend ridership drops by over 70%, highlighting an opportunity for weekend promotions to boost ridership and revenue.

### 5. Weekend Promo Success
- A targeted "all-you-can-ride" promo for Millennials and Gen Z females increased weekend revenue by 61%, from IDR 10.5M to IDR 19.1M, indicating the effectiveness of targeted promotions in boosting off-peak ridership.

### 6. Commuter Pass Implementation
- The introduction of a commuter pass led to a 30% increase in weekday revenue, from IDR 112.3M to IDR 145.8M, benefiting frequent users such as students and workers. The pass encouraged long-term customer retention and offered an affordable option for regular commuters.

## Implications and Suggestions

### Strategic Targeting
- Focus marketing campaigns on Millennials and Gen Z, particularly females, through platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Offer promotions tailored to student and family groups, especially during weekends.

### Partnerships
- Collaborate with Bank DKI and other digital payment providers to offer exclusive discounts and loyalty programs for cashless transactions.

### Operational Improvements
- Allocate additional buses and staff during peak hours (6-7 AM and 5-6 PM) to address demand. Enhance station infrastructure at high-traffic stations like Garuda Taman Mini.

### Weekend Utilization
- Expand successful weekend promotions, such as the "all-you-can-ride" package, to additional routes and time periods to increase off-peak ridership.

### Revenue Optimization
- Explore ways to monetize JakLingko, which serves a subsidized purpose, while maintaining its accessibility-focused mission.
